# Citi bike data analysis for June 2023

1. In  dashbaord1, I have showcased data for member vs casual rider. Two charts contains the popular start and end stations for member as well as casual rider. There is a pie chart which shows the total number of users thar are members and casual riders.
With line chart, I have showed the trips per day for member and casual rider and it seems that it does not have nay relation as such. Days where number of trips are high for members and low trips for casual. This might be because of members are using it for transport in weekdays for office and casual riders are using for tourism which will be mostly in weekend.

2. In Dashboard2,  I have included top 10 stations where people started thier strips and top 10 stations where they ended there trip. I have also inlcuded total trips for period June 2023.
With use of map, I have showcases trip count at specific start stations with details of Lat and long while cliv over.And lastly. I have included a line chart where I have showcases busy hours where maximum trips are occured. Most trips are occured during 5PM TO 6PM which is mostly end of the day when people return to hom after office.
